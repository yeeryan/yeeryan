# Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Ryan and I'm a data analyst with growth marketing experience located in Queens, NY. 
I love the challenge of uncovering insights hidden in datasets, and find working with data to be highly stimulating and rewarding. 
On my GitHub, I share my personal projects where I aim to expand my data skillset, practice my storytelling, and discover some new insights!
